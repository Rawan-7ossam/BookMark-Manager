* **Add New Bookmarks:** Users can easily input a website's name and its corresponding URL into dedicated fields.
* **Real-time Input Validation:** Provides immediate visual feedback (e.g., border color changes, validation icons) as the user types, ensuring the bookmark name adheres to specified rules (at least 3 characters, allowing letters, numbers, spaces, and underscores) and the URL is in a valid format.
* **Dynamic Bookmark Listing:** All saved bookmarks are displayed in a clean, tabular format, updating instantly as new entries are added or existing ones are modified/deleted.
* **Direct Website Access:** A "Visit" button for each bookmark allows users to open the saved website in a new browser tab with a single click.
* **Bookmark Management:** Includes a "Delete" function to easily remove unwanted entries from the list.
* **Persistent Storage:** All bookmark data is stored directly in the user's browser using Local Storage, ensuring that saved sites are retained even after the browser is closed and reopened.
